 * (an intermediary expiring an idle flow without notifying either end) and
 * replace it, instead of letting a dead session fail every call until the
 * process restarts — or, on serverless, leaving a GOAWAY from a peer-closed
 * idle connection as an uncaught exception on a frozen instance.
 *
 * @param baseUrl Base URL for the Arcjet API.
